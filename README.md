## Usage

Users can create a new vehicle by selecting a type—car, truck, or motorbike—and providing relevant details, or they can choose an existing vehicle from a list. After selecting or creating a vehicle, users are presented with a list of specific actions they can perform to control the vehicle. Each action provides immediate feedback within the command-line interface.

The application supports repeated use, enabling users to create, select, and interact with vehicles as many times as desired until they choose to exit.``
